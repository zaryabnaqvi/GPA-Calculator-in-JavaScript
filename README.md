## Description
This is my first program on javaScript.In this program I dont use any advance techniques.<br>
This program shows my basic understanding regarding html,css and javaScript that how <br>
the Id,class,functions and styling works.<br>
I mostly use array data structure in this program. I store all the values in arrays and<br> 
Work with them by using different techniques.<br>
## Algorithm
1.Store all the values in arrays.<br>
2.Convert marks into their respective gpa's.<br>
3.Multiply gpa's by credit hours.<br>
4.Take the sum of all gpa's then divide them by total credit hours.<br>
5.We get the gpa.<br>
